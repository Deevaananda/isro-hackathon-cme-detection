# GitHub Setup Instructions for CME Detection Project

## 🚀 Complete GitHub Upload Instructions

You have successfully initialized your Git repository! Here are the next steps to upload to GitHub:

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open https://github.com/Deevaananda
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `isro-hackathon-cme-detection` 
   - **Description**: `ISRO Hackathon PS10 - Advanced CME Detection System with Solar-L1 Propagation Modeling`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Deevaananda/isro-hackathon-cme-detection.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
gh repo create isro-hackathon-cme-detection --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### 4. Verify Upload

After pushing, verify that your repository is live at:
https://github.com/Deevaananda/isro-hackathon-cme-detection
